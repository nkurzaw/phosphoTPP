abstract = {Proteins differentially interact with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation ({TPCA}) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of protein complex dynamics. Significant {TPCA} signatures observed among well-validated protein-protein interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human protein complexes. Using {TPCA}, we identified many complexes without detectable differential protein expression, including chromatin-associated complexes, modulated in S phase of the cell cycle. Comparison of six cell lines by {TPCA} revealed cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. {TPCA} constitutes an approach for system-wide studies of protein complexes in nonengineered cells and tissues and might be used to identify protein complexes that are modulated in diseases.

abstract = {The thermal stability of proteins can be used to assess ligand binding in living cells. We have generalized this concept by determining the thermal profiles of more than 7000 proteins in human cells by means of mass spectrometry. Monitoring the effects of small-molecule ligands on the profiles delineated more than 50 targets for the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase as a target of kinase inhibitors and suggest that its inhibition causes the phototoxicity observed with vemurafenib and alectinib. Thermal shifts were also observed for downstream effectors of drug treatment. In live cells, dasatinib induced shifts in {BCR}-{ABL} pathway proteins, including {CRK}/{CRKL}. Thermal proteome profiling provides an unbiased measure of drug-target engagement and facilitates identification of markers for drug efficacy and toxicity.

abstract = {Reversible protein phosphorylation regulates virtually every cellular process and is arguably the most well-studied post-translational modification. Still, less than 3\% of the phosphorylation sites identified in humans have annotated functions. Functionally-relevant phosphorylation sites are known to trigger conformational changes to proteins and/or to regulate their interactions with other proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules - all of which can be reflected in the thermal stability of a protein. Thus, combining thermal proteome profiling ({TPP}) with phosphoproteomics (phospho-{TPP}) provides a way to assess the functional relevance of identified phosphorylation sites on a proteome-wide scale by comparing the melting behavior of a protein and its phosphorylated form(s). We performed phospho-{TPP} experiments in {HeLa} cells with an optimized protocol, and conclude that phosphorylation does affect protein thermal stability, but to a much lesser extent than previously reported.}

abstract = {Mass spectrometry enables global analysis of posttranslationally modified proteoforms from biological samples, yet we still lack methods to systematically predict, or even prioritize, which modification sites may perturb protein function. Here we describe a proteomic method, Hotspot Thermal Profiling, to detect the effects of site-specific protein phosphorylation on the thermal stability of thousands of native proteins in live cells. This massively parallel biophysical assay unveiled shifts in overall protein stability in response to site-specific phosphorylation sites, as well as trends related to protein function and structure. This method can detect intrinsic changes to protein structure as well as extrinsic changes to protein-protein and protein-metabolite interactions resulting from phosphorylation. Finally, we show that functional 'hotspot' protein modification sites can be discovered and prioritized for study in a high-throughput and unbiased fashion. This approach is applicable to diverse organisms, cell types and posttranslational modifications.}

abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification regulating protein function in almost all cellular processes. Although tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells, approaches to determine the functional importance of each phosphosite are lacking. Here, we manually curated 112 datasets of phospho-enriched proteins, generated from 104 different human cell types or tissues. We re-analyzed the 6,801 proteomics experiments that passed our quality control criteria, creating a reference phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional sites, we used machine learning to identify 59 features indicative of proteomic, structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance and integrate them into a single functional score. Our approach identifies regulatory phosphosites across different molecular mechanisms, processes and diseases, and reveals genetic susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several regulatory phosphosites were experimentally validated, including identifying a role in neuronal differentiation for phosphosites in {SMARCC2}, a member of the {SWI}/{SNF} chromatin-remodeling complex.}
